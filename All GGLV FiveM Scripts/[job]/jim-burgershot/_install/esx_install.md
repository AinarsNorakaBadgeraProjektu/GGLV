# Item installation

- **This script only supports `ox_inventory` when running `ESX`**
- Add the images from `_install > images` to your inventory folder eg. `ox_inventory > data > items.lua`
- Add the `ox_items.txt` to your `ox_inventory > data > items.lua`

- To make use of the `murderbag` you need to add this code to `ox_inventory/modules/items/containers.lua`
- Right above `return containers` at the bottom of the file add:

```lua
setContainerProperties('murderbag', {
	slots = 5,
	maxWeight = 1000,
})
```

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Job installation

- Import the `esx_jobs.sql` into your database to add the jobs and their grades

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Add the script to the server resources

- It is highly recommend to put this script folder in a new folder called `[jim]`
- Then add `ensure [jim]` AFTER your other scripts in your server.cfg

GO TO YOUR `server.cfg`

## Stash Crafting

- This script includes an optional stash crafting feature, which is `disabled` by default.
- In the location configuration files, you’ll find a commented out `StashCraft` option.
- Uncommenting this line designates the specified stash as a *crafting stash*.
- When enabled, players can craft items directly from the stash without needing to carry materials in their inventory.
- Crafted items will be delivered directly to the player's pockets.
- Once a stash is marked for crafting, its target option will display an asterisk (`*`) to indicate it is the active crafting stash.
- This helps players easily identify which stash is used for crafting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Jim-Payments (Required/Optional) - (https://github.com/jimathy/jim-payments)

- This is the default system for payments in the script but can easily be changed in `client.lua`
- When triggered gets a list of the nearest players and lets you choose which one to charge
- I class it as `optional` because you don't specifically need it if you have another you want to use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Jim-Consumables (Optional) - (https://github.com/jimathy/jim-consumables)

- If `jim-consumables` is installed, the script will attempt to reroute consumables
- The server side will automatically add the items to `jim-consumables` (edit any values you wish there)
- When used the item will trigger the `jim-script:client:consume` event which detects wether to use built in event's or `jim-consuambles` (if found)
